    /*
    Classes and Objects

    class is a blueprint for objects
    blueprint is like a scheme, layout, template,pla, project etc

    you can create as many objects as you like from one class

    all of your code must be inside the class

    There are 2 types of attributes:
    - variables
    - methods

    You can create as many methods and variables as u like inside one class.

    Variables are containers that store data
    Methods are actions, they do something
    Main method is a starting point of the application. When you start your application, you actually start your main method.
    public.static.void.main(System args [])
    Object is an instance(means result) of the class

    =====================STATIC================================
    static is a keyword in Java
    keywords means a word which ws reserved by Java and which cannot be used in
    any other purposes except for the given purpose.

    The attributes: methods and variables
    They belong either to class, or to object

    static - means tha this attribute ( variable ?method ) belongs to class.
    non static - means instance - means belongs to object
    ==============================
    static - belongs to class
    instance - belongs to object
    +======================
    STATIC METHOD
    public static void method(){
    }
    ===========================
    STATIC VARIABLE
    static int num =5;
    =============================
    INSTANCE VARIABLE
    int = 5

    ============================
    RULES RULES RULES
    1)static variable can be accessed from both static and instance methods directly
    directly - means without creating object or using class name
    2) instance variable can be accessed from instance method directly,
    but to be accessed from static method , we need to create object first and then call the variable
    3)  static variables can only created
